RAG SDK Documentation

The RAG SDK is a modular framework for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications.
It supports various providers for embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere), vector stores (Pinecone, Weaviate), and LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic).

Key Components:
1. Document Processing: Loaders and Splitters.
2. Embeddings: Text-to-vector conversion.
3. Vector Store: Efficient similarity search.
4. Retrieval: Hybrid search strategies.
5. LLM: Response generation.

Configuration is managed via YAML files or environment variables.
